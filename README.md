## Design

### Colour Scheme

I wanted to keep the colour scheme in a formal/newpaper style. The colour palette is used is here: [coolors](https://coolors.co/000100-a1a6b4-94c5cc-b4d2e7-f8f8f8)

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* Playfair is used for the body on the site.

* Roboto is used for the navbar and footer on the site. 

### Imagery

All blog header images were taken from the publishers websites. I have credited these in the credits section. They are uploaded to cloudinary storage.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop here: [Home Page Wireframe](./assets/readme/wireframe.png)

### Database Model

  In the top right of the navbar when logged in is a message letting you know you are logged in. 
  * A footer which contains social media icon links to Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Github. There is also a copyright mark underneath the icons.

### Future Implementations.
  * Only allow a user to edit and delete posts that they created. 

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible and friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
